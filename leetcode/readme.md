# LeetCode Solutions and Notes Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! Here I organize all the code solutions I have completed and detailed notes for some problems. I hope this helps myself and others better review and understand algorithm problems.

## Repository Structure

- `solutions/`  
  This folder contains all the code files for problems I have solved.  

  File names are formatted with the problem number and title, for example: `1_two_sum.py`.  

  If I have detailed notes for a problem, it will be indicated in the file name, for example: `1_two_sum_with_note.py`.

- `notes/`   
This folder contains detailed notes for various problems in Markdown files. Each file corresponds to one problem and may include the problem title, LeetCode link, solution approach, complexity analysis, usage summaries, or other related explanations. Some notes focus on solution methods, while others provide usage summaries or problem insights.

## How to Use

- To view problem code, open the `solutions` folder and find the file by problem number.  
- The problem title and LeetCode link are written in comments at the top of each code file.
- This repository is continuously updated. Feedback and discussions are welcome!

## My Study Plan

- Keep solving problems while maintaining clean code and clear comments.  
- Prioritize writing detailed notes for difficult and key problems to facilitate review.
